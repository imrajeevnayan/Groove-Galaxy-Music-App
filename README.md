## ðŸ”Š Add Real Song Playback

Groove Galaxy is UI-only by default. To enable music playback, you can:

### âœ… Option 1: Host your own MP3 files

1. Upload `.mp3` files to a `/songs/` folder.
2. Update the `data-src` on each play button:
   ```html
   <button class="play-button" data-src="songs/the-fate-of-ophelia.mp3">
